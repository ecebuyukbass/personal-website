      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with a passion for the details. My work bridges the gap between complex logic and user experience, primarily using Java and React.

I treat software development as a craft.
 Whether I'm designing a database schema or optimizing a React hook,
  my focus is always on best practices and long-term maintainability. 
  This website is my open lab—a place where I share my experiments, projects, and the lessons
   I learn while navigating the ever-changing landscape of technology.
